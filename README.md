### Cycle 2 project for 67-475 -- Innovation in Information Systems
Teammates: Maggie Li and Chris Compendio

Chomp on the go lets you plot a route between two locations and specify when and where you want to get food. The app will update your route based on restaurant choice. 

Note: Alternating between the Search and Restaurants views too frequently will reach my Google Maps API request frequency limit and cause the restaurant listings to not show distance away from ideal stopping point.
